# Undercover



## Getting started

The objective is to code a player to the game [Undercover](https://www.yanstarstudio.com/en/undercover-game/).

## Dependency

You must install scikit-network to download the list of words:

`pip install scikit-network`

## Coding your player

You must code three functions (speak, vote, guess) in Python using the format given in the file player.py.

Please note that:

1. The words must belong to the [Small World of Words](https://netset.telecom-paris.fr/pages/swow.html) -- see player.py.
2. The votes are secret.

## Testing your player

The file test.py allows to test your player (to be done).
