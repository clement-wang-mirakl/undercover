# Undercover



## Getting started

The objective is to code a player to the game [Undercover](https://www.yanstarstudio.com/en/undercover-game/).

## Dependency

You must install [scikit-network](https://scikit-network.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to download the list of words:

`pip install scikit-network`

## Coding your player

You must code three functions (speak, vote, guess) in Python using the format given in the file player.py.

Please note that:

1. The words must belong to the [Small World of Words](https://netset.telecom-paris.fr/pages/swow.html).
2. The order of players is random at each round.
3. The votes are secret.

## Testing your player

Please test your player using test.py.
